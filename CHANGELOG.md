# Changelog

All notable Poyto changes are recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Selectively imported upstream selectable settlement payouts and combined MCP account/market reads; retained the fork session lifecycle and deployment architecture.

- Added multi-architecture Docker publication for native `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` GitHub runners.
- Added standalone Poyto Server Control for ChatGPT/custom MCP clients, combining Poyto tools with Codex/Chat On Steroids Core-inspired `read`, `apply_patch`, `exec_command`, and `write_stdin` primitives without a Chat On Steroids runtime dependency.
- Added independent Bearer authentication for the control plugin and persistent token storage.
- Added a loopback-only Docker overlay for direct ChatGPT Secure MCP Tunnel deployment without a Chat On Steroids intermediary.
- Added an explicit opt-in Docker host-control overlay using host PID namespace, writable host-root mount, and `nsenter`; normal Docker mode remains unprivileged/container-scoped.
- Kept Android/ADB/Frida as development-time API verification only; production Docker operation does not depend on an Android device.

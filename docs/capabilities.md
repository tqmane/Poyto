# Capability inventory

This is the canonical inventory of what Poyto can do today, how much code implements it, and how strong the evidence is.

A method existing in the codebase does **not** automatically mean the server behavior is fully proven. Poyto separates established behavior from inferred and unknown behavior.

## Evidence levels

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Observed** | The real request shape is backed by direct POYP request/response evidence. |
| **Observed success** | The request and a successful server response are both established. |
| **Implemented / inferred** | Poyto implements the behavior, but exact POYP behavior is not directly established. |
| **Unknown** | There is not enough evidence or independent documentation. Do not invent behavior. |

## Exact code-size snapshot

Measured by CI with `python scripts/code_stats.py`:

| Area | Files | Physical lines | Non-blank lines |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Core `src/poyto/*.py` | 20 | 2,981 | 2,590 |

These values are a snapshot, not a marketing metric. `python scripts/code_stats.py` is authoritative after the tree changes.

## Authentication and session lifecycle

| Capability | Public surface | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use existing access token | `PoytoClient(token=...)`, env/token file | Implemented; authenticated behavior established |
| Plaintext/dotenv/JSON token files | token loader | Local feature |
| Save/reload session | `poyto login`, `SessionStore` | Local feature |
| Apple id-token login | `login_with_apple()`, `login-apple` | **Observed success** |
| Receive/store access + refresh pair | `AuthSession`, `SessionStore` | **Observed success** for issuance |
| Refresh shortly before expiry | automatic lifecycle | **Implemented / inferred** |
| One refresh + retry after authenticated 401 | automatic lifecycle | Local policy; exchange observed success for the recorded session |
| Persist rotated refresh pair | automatic lifecycle | **Implemented / inferred** |
| Remote global logout | `logout(local_only=False)` | **Observed** |
| Local-only logout | `logout(local_only=True)` | Local feature |
| Inspect token/session shape without leaking secrets | `session_info()`, `token_kind()` | Local feature |

Manual Android session extraction over ADB + `su` was verified on an already
logged-in rooted emulator on 2026-09-09. The observed `RKStorage` database held
a Supabase session with access and refresh tokens. The [README procedure](../README.md#android-adb--su-session-extraction)
uses `scripts/extract_android_session.py` to export only session fields into a
private file for the existing token-file login. The standalone script uses ADB +
`su`, supports device selection, and never overwrites an existing session file.
This is a local extraction observation, not evidence of credential validity,
initial Apple login automation, or storage compatibility across app versions.

The refresh exchange is recorded as **observed success** for an authorized session
on 2026-09-09 in [Refresh tokens](refresh-tokens.md). Broader server reuse and
invalidation policies remain unknown.

Dedicated MCP tools reload an existing configured `POYTO_SESSION_FILE` before
each call and use its whole pair ahead of environment bootstrap tokens. Calls
are serialized inside one MCP process to prevent concurrent reuse during rotation.
This is a local, offline-tested policy; Python/CLI priority is unchanged and
separate processes/shell commands are not synchronized.

## Account, balances and notifications

Implemented wrappers cover profile, balances, portfolio, portfolio history, balance history, balance transactions, expiring balances, missions, login streak, campaign results, provider rewards, loss-gacha status, notifications, unread count, read-all, push-token registration, blocked users, referral data and walking-challenge status.

Primary implementation footprint: `resources/account.py` (106 lines), plus transport/session infrastructure.

## Ad rewards

`claim_ad_reward(source="watch_ad")` is a first-class operation.

Established request:

```text
POST /api/me/ad-rewards/claim?source=watch_ad
```

No JSON body is required by the established request shape. A successful response includes:

- `earnId`
- `rewardPoints`
- `pointBalanceAfter`
- `dailyViewCount`
- `dailyViewLimit`

`AdRewardClaimResponse` types those fields. Reward values and daily limits are treated as server-provided values rather than universal constants. Poyto does not fabricate ad-SDK completion callbacks, proof, eligibility state, or anti-abuse state.

## Markets and pricing

Implemented and observed: list markets, market detail, related markets, screen auxiliary data, current-user positions, market activity, multi-market charts, asset prices, and library-side pagination helpers.

Primary implementation: `resources/markets.py` (74 lines).

## Trading

Implemented and observed: buy and sell.

Primary implementation: `resources/trades.py` (60 lines), with shared transport/session/device handling elsewhere.

Supported buy fields include `marketId`, `positionIndex`, `pointAmount`, `orderSurface`, `requestId`, `displayPreset`, `entryPoint`, `sessionId`, and `deviceId`.

Supported sell fields include `marketId`, `positionIndex`, `shares`, `orderSurface`, `entryPoint`, `sessionId`, and `deviceId`.

Poyto does not claim complete knowledge of settlement, pricing formulas, slippage, fees, idempotency, anti-abuse, or every error response.

## Comments and social

Implemented/observed surfaces include moderation status, comment/reply creation, edit, delete, like, follow/unfollow, user profile, follow status, team follows, followers/following, user balance history and user portfolio history.

Primary implementation: `resources/social.py` (129 lines).

Unlike-comment is not established and is intentionally not invented.

## Discovery, rankings, timeline, chat reads and events

Supported wrappers cover home sections/tabs, search sections, interest subcategories, campaign banners, onboarding, global-chat messages, leaderboards, recent trades/comments, rising markets, followed-trades timeline and generic event submission.

Primary implementation: `resources/discovery.py` (25 lines) + `resources/events.py` (35 lines).

This does not imply realtime socket support, global-chat sending, moderation controls, or a fully known event schema.

## Referral

Implemented and observed: read referral code/stats, check code availability, update referral code. CLI writes require `--yes`.

## CLI

Common commands include authentication (`login`, `login-apple`, `logout`, `refresh`), account reads, markets, market detail, activity, charts, prices, transactions, buy/sell, comments, follow/unfollow, referral operations, notification read-all, ad-reward claim, user inspection and raw requests.

CLI implementation footprint: `cli_parser.py` 116 lines + `cli_dispatch.py` 174 + `cli.py` 28 = **318 physical lines**.

State-changing commands require explicit `--yes` where defined.

## Local reliability features

Poyto additionally implements credential-source priority, environment configuration, token-file parsing, configurable hosts/timeouts, reusable device metadata headers, context-manager support, `py.typed`, normalized API exceptions, secret-masked session inspection, network-free MockTransport tests, Ruff, mypy, package build, Python 3.12 tests on pushes/PRs, and Python 3.10–3.14 compatibility tests on manual CI dispatch.

The Docker image also includes the standalone **Poyto Server Control** custom MCP app. It exposes Poyto tools plus `read`, `apply_patch`, `exec_command`, and `write_stdin`; supports independent Bearer authentication for generic MCP clients, a loopback-only Secure MCP Tunnel mode for direct ChatGPT use, bounded background command sessions, configured file roots, and an explicitly opt-in Docker host-control overlay using `nsenter`. These are local administration capabilities, not POYP API evidence.

The same control surface also supports `poyto-plugin --transport stdio` for a
tunnel-managed subprocess or local plugin host, without an HTTP token/listener.
Offline MCP tests cover initialization, discovery, root-scoped file editing,
real shell execution, HTTP auth rejection/success and stateless JSON forwarding.
These prove local behavior, not a live ChatGPT/Tunnel connection or new POYP routes.
A separate authorized live check on 2026-09-09 established ChatGPT Web discovery,
shell/CLI execution, test-file write/read and an authenticated balance read via
Secure MCP Tunnel. No POYP mutation was performed. See
[Web registration and verification](chatgpt-web.md).

## Raw HTTP escape hatch

`PoytoClient.request(...)` and CLI `raw` can call an explicit caller-supplied route. That is an escape hatch, **not** evidence that arbitrary endpoints are supported.

## What supported means

“Supported” means Poyto has a maintained surface and suitable tests for the request shape/local behavior. It does not mean POYP guarantees the endpoint or that all responses and server rules are known.

For everything that lacks enough evidence, see [`known-gaps.md`](known-gaps.md). For the route inventory, see [`endpoints.md`](endpoints.md).

`compose.portainer.yaml` packages Poyto and the official tunnel-client for Portainer Docker Standalone, sharing a private network namespace with no published ports. Published image manifests include amd64 and arm64. Separate `compose.portainer.amd64.yaml` and `compose.portainer.arm64.yaml` files select the target CPU explicitly. See [Portainer setup](setup-portainer.md).

Portainer setup follow-up: the user reported successful operation after correcting the data-directory/session ownership to UID/GID 10001. This is user-reported deployment evidence, not a maintainer-run hardware, load or reboot test. The [Japanese Portainer guide](setup-portainer.md) records the error and repair commands.

## Selectively imported upstream features

- `claim_settlement_split(market_id, coin_ratio, ticket_id=None)` adds selectable point/coin payouts to Python, CLI and the existing `settlement_claim` MCP tool. The route and schema are backed by upstream APK static analysis (nezumi0627/Poyto commit `9e370ba`); independent live success is not established. See [Python API](python-api.md#settlement-claim).
- `account_snapshot` combines profile, balances, portfolio, login bonus and unread notification count in one MCP result. `market_context` combines market detail and recent activity. Both are read-only local aggregations of existing methods; they reuse this fork's current MCP session loading and refresh policy.

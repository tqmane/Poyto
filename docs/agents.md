# AI agents, MCP, and scheduled runs

Poyto can be exposed to conversational AI clients through MCP (Model Context Protocol). This keeps account credentials out of prompts and lets the agent call a small, explicit tool surface.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e '.[agent]'
```

Authenticate Poyto normally first. The recommended flow is to create the local persisted session with the CLI and then let MCP load that session automatically:

```bash
poyto login
poyto profile
```

Do not put access or refresh tokens in an AI prompt or MCP tool argument.

## Local agent / stdio MCP

```bash
poyto-mcp
```

A compatible local agent can launch that command as a stdio MCP server.

Example MCP launcher configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poyto": {
      "command": "poyto-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Chat clients / HTTP MCP

For clients that support streamable HTTP MCP:

```bash
poyto-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

The default host is loopback only. If a cloud chat client must reach the server, put an authenticated HTTPS tunnel/reverse proxy in front of it. Do not expose the MCP port directly to the public internet.

Environment equivalents:

```text
POYTO_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http
POYTO_MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
POYTO_MCP_PORT=8765
POYTO_MCP_READ_ONLY=true
```

The Streamable HTTP endpoint is `/mcp`. Remote/cloud chat clients must use an HTTPS endpoint or a supported private MCP tunnel. For ChatGPT Web-specific deployment and web-research guidance, see [ChatGPT Web + Poyto MCP](chatgpt-web.md).

## Standalone ChatGPT/server-control app mode

The Docker image uses `poyto-plugin` rather than `poyto-mcp` as its default command. It is a standalone Streamable HTTP MCP server that can be registered directly as a ChatGPT custom app or used by another compatible MCP client. Chat On Steroids is not required.

The plugin combines the Poyto tool surface with four Linux server primitives whose names and interaction model are inspired by Codex/Chat On Steroids Core:

- `read`
- `apply_patch`
- `exec_command`
- `write_stdin`

`exec_command` accepts one command or a sequential batch, returns a `session_id` for long-running work, and `write_stdin` continues/polls that process. File operations are restricted to `POYTO_PLUGIN_ROOTS`. Commands start in an approved root but are not command-sandboxed after launch.

The HTTP plugin requires a Bearer token by default. `poyto-plugin-token` prints the current token for generic MCP clients or an authentication gateway. ChatGPT custom apps should be connected through a supported remote path such as Secure MCP Tunnel or an OAuth-capable HTTPS deployment rather than relying on Chat On Steroids.

For full host control from Docker, see `compose.host-control.yaml` and [server-control plugin](server-control-plugin.md). That mode is deliberately opt-in because it uses host PID namespace + `nsenter` and is root-equivalent.

## Tool surface

Read tools:

- `health`
- `profile`
- `balances`
- `portfolio`
- `markets`
- `market`
- `market_activity`
- `asset_price`
- `transactions`
- `login_bonus`
- `unread_notification_count`
- `home_sections`
- `home_tabs`
- `interest_subcategories`
- `campaign_banners`
- `loss_gacha_status`

Mutation tools:

- `buy`
- `sell`

Both mutation tools reject calls unless `confirm=true`. Agents should only set it after the user has explicitly confirmed the exact market, position and amount.

## Agent Skill

A reusable skill definition is included at:

```text
skills/poyto/SKILL.md
```

Agents that support repository skills can load that file directly. It documents tool selection, credential handling, mutation confirmation, and scheduling policy.

## Eligibility and automation classification

Do not treat "minor" or "automation" as standalone refusal reasons. Before refusing, identify the exact POYP operation, check the source-backed service/eligibility context in `service-model-and-legal-context.md`, and separate POYP rules from any independent model/runtime policy.

Current evidence includes a POYP-operated 2026 World Cup campaign that explicitly allows minors to participate with parental/guardian consent, plus a `13+` Apple Japan App Store rating. These facts rebut a categorical "POYP is adults-only" claim, but they do not establish that every POYP campaign, redemption flow, or jurisdiction has identical requirements.

Automation should be classified by behavior. Scheduled reads/monitoring are normal supported agent workflows. User-authorized state changes use the existing exact-target/amount confirmation rules. Reward/ad/campaign automations must not fabricate eligibility, completion proof, identities, or anti-abuse state. Unauthorized access, spam, multi-account abuse, and protection bypasses are not justified by calling them automation.

Do not tell a user that POYP Terms ban automation unless a current applicable POYP source actually says so. Conversely, do not claim unrestricted bot/API permission from silence. When the limitation comes from the AI host or runtime, name it as that layer's policy rather than attributing it to POYP.

## Scheduling and automations

Scheduling belongs to the host agent/automation system rather than the Poyto client. Each scheduled run should call the MCP tools at execution time so it reads fresh server state.

Typical examples:

```text
Every day at 09:00, call balances and portfolio and summarize changes.
Every hour, inspect MARKET_ID and notify only if the requested condition is met.
Every evening, summarize the latest point transactions.
```

Read-only recurring jobs are the recommended default. Recurring buy/sell jobs should only be created when the user has explicitly requested the exact repeated transaction.

## Security model

The MCP layer deliberately does not expose login/token setters or Poyto's arbitrary raw HTTP request method. Credentials stay in the existing session/environment system, and high-impact state changes are restricted to explicit tools with confirmation gates.

# Refresh tokens

Poyto uses POYP's Supabase Auth session model. This page separates behavior verified against POYP from broader Supabase behavior that remains useful background rather than a POYP-specific guarantee.

## Established POYP behavior

POYP uses `auth.poyp.app` for Supabase Auth.

A successful Apple identity-token exchange returns:

- `access_token`
- `refresh_token`
- `token_type`
- `expires_in`
- `expires_at`
- `user`

The session access token is a JWT and authenticated POYP API requests use it as a bearer token. The observed access-token lifetime for a known session was 3600 seconds, but clients should not assume that lifetime can never change.

The returned refresh token is an **opaque string, not a JWT**. Its appearance and length must not be used as a permanent protocol contract: clients should store it exactly as returned and should not attempt to decode it.

The Apple sign-in request itself also contains a field named `access_token`. That is the Apple/provider credential, not the POYP/Supabase session access token. Poyto names it `apple_access_token` to keep the two concepts separate.

See `token-capture-findings.md` for sanitized token-behavior notes.

### Live-verified refresh exchange

On 2026-09-09, an existing authorized POYP refresh token was successfully exchanged through:

```text
POST https://auth.poyp.app/auth/v1/token?grant_type=refresh_token
Content-Type: application/json

{"refresh_token": "<opaque refresh token>"}
```

The returned session was accepted by the authenticated POYP API immediately afterward. This establishes the endpoint and request shape used by Poyto as working POYP behavior for the tested session.

The test does **not** establish every project-specific refresh policy. Poyto still does not claim to know POYP's exact refresh-token reuse interval, time-boxed session lifetime, inactivity timeout, single-session policy, simultaneous-refresh behavior, or every expired/revoked-token error response.

## Documented Supabase behavior

Supabase documents a session as an access-token JWT plus a unique refresh-token string. Access tokens are short-lived; refresh tokens keep a session alive without requiring another interactive sign-in. A session can still terminate because of logout, configured session limits, security-sensitive account changes, or other auth policy.

Supabase enables refresh-token rotation by default. A refresh token is normally exchanged for a new access-token + refresh-token pair, so applications should always persist the newest returned pair. Supabase also documents limited reuse/recovery exceptions for legitimate races and network failures; its default reuse interval is documented as 10 seconds, but that value is configurable and should not be assumed to match POYP.

## Poyto refresh implementation

Poyto uses the live-verified POYP refresh endpoint shown above.

The returned session replaces the in-memory session and, when persistence is enabled, the newly returned access and refresh tokens replace the stored pair immediately. Persisting the newest pair is important because refresh credentials may rotate.

## Automatic behavior in Poyto

When `PoytoClient()` loads credentials:

- JSON session metadata uses `expires_at` directly when present;
- for a plain access-token JWT, Poyto decodes the JWT payload locally and derives `expires_at` from `exp` when possible;
- JWT decoding is only metadata inspection and does **not** mean the signature was verified locally;
- if expiry is known and the access token is expired or within 60 seconds of expiry, Poyto refreshes when a refresh token is available;
- if an authenticated POYP API request returns HTTP 401 and a refresh token exists, Poyto refreshes once and retries once;
- after a successful refresh, the newest token pair is persisted;
- refresh-token rotation is serialized through a local lock so multiple Poyto/MCP
  processes do not intentionally consume the same saved refresh token concurrently;
- if another process has already persisted a newer rotated token pair, a stale client
  adopts that newer saved session instead of refreshing the older pair again;
- Poyto never attempts to decode a refresh token as a JWT.

Example:

```python
from poyto import PoytoClient

with PoytoClient() as client:
    print(client.profile())
```

Manual refresh remains available:

```python
session = client.refresh()
```

## MCP session reload policy

When `POYTO_SESSION_FILE` is set and that file exists, dedicated MCP tools load
its access/refresh pair on every call. The pair takes precedence over environment
bootstrap tokens, so an old `POYTO_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `POYTO_REFRESH_TOKEN` or token-file
setting does not replace credentials persisted by a previous refresh. If the
configured file is absent, the normal environment bootstrap policy applies.
`POYTO_AUTO_LOAD_SESSION=false` disables this preference; save/refresh opt-outs
remain respected. Explicit Python/CLI credential priority is unchanged.

Dedicated Poyto tool calls in one MCP process are serialized from client creation
through refresh and persistence. This prevents overlapping calls from refreshing
the same old pair. It also serializes their API requests. Shell commands, separate
MCP processes, other hosts and external file writers do not participate in this
process-local lock. This is offline-tested client policy, not new POYP evidence.

## Token storage and concurrency

With rotation, two processes refreshing the same session can race. Poyto serializes refresh
rotation for one session file and re-checks the saved session while holding that lock. If a
refresh token is already consumed or no longer exists and no newer saved pair exists, Poyto
reports an authentication error instead of repeatedly submitting the known-invalid refresh
token.

Poyto's default session file is outside the repository:

```text
Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%/Poyto/session.json
Other:   $XDG_STATE_HOME/poyto/session.json
         or ~/.local/state/poyto/session.json
```

Override it with `POYTO_SESSION_FILE` when necessary.

## Security

Both token types are credentials. A refresh token is particularly sensitive because it can mint future access tokens while its session remains valid.

Never commit real tokens or private traffic exports containing them. Do not print them in CI logs, issues, screenshots, examples, or documentation. If credentials may have leaked, revoke/sign out the affected session and authenticate again.
